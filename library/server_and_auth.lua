-- * `core.request_shutdown([message],[reconnect],[delay])`: request for
--   server shutdown. Will display `message` to clients.
--     * `reconnect` == true displays a reconnect button
--     * `delay` adds an optional delay (in seconds) before shutdown.
--       Negative delay cancels the current active shutdown.
--       Zero delay triggers an immediate shutdown.
---@param message string?
---@param reconnect boolean?
---@param delay number?
function core.request_shutdown(message, reconnect, delay) end

-- * `core.cancel_shutdown_requests()`: cancel current delayed shutdown
function core.cancel_shutdown_requests() end

-- Unofficial note: This is really cool i didn't know this
-- * `core.get_server_status(name, joined)`
--     * Returns the server status string when a player joins or when the command
--       `/status` is called. Returns `nil` or an empty string when the message is
--       disabled.
--     * `joined`: Boolean value, indicates whether the function was called when
--       a player joined.
--     * This function may be overwritten by mods to customize the status message.

-- * `core.get_server_uptime()`: returns the server uptime in seconds
---@return number
function core.get_server_uptime() end

-- * `core.get_server_max_lag()`: returns the current maximum lag
--   of the server in seconds or nil if server is not fully loaded yet
---@return number?
function core.get_server_max_lag() end

-- * `core.remove_player(name)`: remove player from database (if they are not
--   connected).
--     * As auth data is not removed, `core.player_exists` will continue to
--       return true. Call the below method as well if you want to remove auth
--       data too.
--     * Returns a code (0: successful, 1: no such player, 2: player is connected)
---@param name string
---@return 0|1|2
function core.remove_player(name) end

-- * `core.remove_player_auth(name)`: remove player authentication data
--     * Returns boolean indicating success (false if player nonexistent)
---@param name string
---@return boolean success
function core.remove_player_auth(name) end

-- * `core.dynamic_add_media(options, callback)`
--     * `options`: table containing the following parameters
--         * `filename`: name the media file will be usable as
--                       (optional if `filepath` present)
--         * `filepath`: path to the file on the filesystem [*]
--         * `filedata`: the data of the file to be sent [*]
--         * `to_player`: name of the player the media should be sent to instead of
--                        all players (optional)
--         * `ephemeral`: boolean that marks the media as ephemeral,
--                        it will not be cached on the client (optional, default false)
--         * Exactly one of the parameters marked [*] must be specified.
--     * `callback`: function with arguments `name`, which is a player name
--     * Pushes the specified media file to client(s). (details below)
--       The file must be a supported image, sound or model format.
--       Dynamically added media is not persisted between server restarts.
--     * Returns false on error, true if the request was accepted
--     * The given callback will be called for every player as soon as the
--       media is available on the client.
--     * Details/Notes:
--       * If `ephemeral`=false and `to_player` is unset the file is added to the media
--         sent to clients on startup, this means the media will appear even on
--         old clients if they rejoin the server.
--       * If `ephemeral`=false the file must not be modified, deleted, moved or
--         renamed after calling this function.
--       * Regardless of any use of `ephemeral`, adding media files with the same
--         name twice is not possible/guaranteed to work. An exception to this is the
--         use of `to_player` to send the same, already existent file to multiple
--         chosen players.
--       * You can also call this at startup time. In that case `callback` MUST
--         be `nil` and you cannot use `ephemeral` or `to_player`, as these logically
--         do not make sense.
--     * Clients will attempt to fetch files added this way via remote media,
--       this can make transfer of bigger files painless (if set up). Nevertheless
--       it is advised not to use dynamic media for big media files.

-- * `core.kick_player(name[, reason[, reconnect]])`: disconnect a player with an optional
--   reason.

-- * `core.disconnect_player(name[, reason[, reconnect]])`: disconnect a player with an
--   optional reason, this will not prefix with 'Kicked: ' like kick_player.
--   If no reason is given, it will default to 'Disconnected.'
--     * Returns boolean indicating success (false if player nonexistent)
---@param name string
