--       * Enter was pressed while the focus was on a text field
--       * a checkbox was toggled,

--       * an entry was double-clicked in a textlist or table,
--       * a scrollbar was moved, or
--       * the form was actively closed by the player.
-- * `formname` is the name passed to `core.show_formspec`.
--   Special case: The empty string refers to the player inventory
--   (the formspec set by the `set_inventory_formspec` player method).
-- * Fields are sent for formspec elements which define a field. `fields`
--   is a table containing each formspecs element value (as string), with
--   the `name` parameter as index for each. The value depends on the
--   formspec element type:
--     * `animated_image`: Returns the index of the current frame.
--     * `button` and variants: If pressed, contains the user-facing button
--       text as value. If not pressed, is `nil`
--     * `field`, `textarea` and variants: Text in the field
--     * `dropdown`: Either the index or value, depending on the `index event`
--       dropdown argument.
--     * `tabheader`: Tab index, starting with `"1"` (only if tab changed)
--     * `checkbox`: `"true"` if checked, `"false"` if unchecked
--     * `textlist`: See `core.explode_textlist_event`
--     * `table`: See `core.explode_table_event`
--     * `scrollbar`: See `core.explode_scrollbar_event`
--     * Special case: `["quit"]="true"` is sent when the user actively
--       closed the form by mouse click, keypress or through a `button_exit[]`
--       element.
--     * Special case: `["try_quit"]="true"` is sent when the user tries to
--       close the formspec, but the formspec used `allow_close[false]`.
--     * Special case: `["key_enter"]="true"` is sent when the user pressed
--       the Enter key and the focus was either nowhere (causing the formspec
--       to be closed) or on a button. If the focus was on a text field,
--       additionally, the index `key_enter_field` contains the name of the
--       text field. See also: `field_close_on_enter`.
