Spatial Vectors
===============

Luanti stores 3-dimensional spatial vectors in Lua as tables of 3 coordinates,
and has a class to represent them (`vector.*`), which this chapter is about.
For details on what a spatial vectors is, please refer to Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector.

Spatial vectors are used for various things, including, but not limited to:

* any 3D spatial vector (x/y/z-directions)
* Euler angles (pitch/yaw/roll in radians) (Spatial vectors have no real semantic
  meaning here. Therefore, most vector operations make no sense in this use case.)

Note that they are *not* used for:

* n-dimensional vectors where n is not 3 (ie. n=2)
* arrays of the form `{num, num, num}`

The API documentation may refer to spatial vectors, as produced by `vector.new`,
by any of the following notations:

* `(x, y, z)` (Used rarely, and only if it's clear that it's a vector.)
* `vector.new(x, y, z)`
* `{x=num, y=num, z=num}` (Even here you are still supposed to use `vector.new`.)


Compatibility notes
-------------------

Vectors used to be defined as tables of the form `{x = num, y = num, z = num}`.
Since version 5.5.0, vectors additionally have a metatable to enable easier use.
Note: Those old-style vectors can still be found in old mod code. Hence, mod and
engine APIs still need to be able to cope with them in many places.

Manually constructed tables are deprecated and highly discouraged. This interface
should be used to ensure seamless compatibility between mods and the Luanti API.
This is especially important to callback function parameters and functions overwritten
by mods.
Also, though not likely, the internal implementation of a vector might change in
the future.
In your own code, or if you define your own API, you can, of course, still use
other representations of vectors.

Vectors provided by API functions will provide an instance of this class if not
stated otherwise. Mods should adapt this for convenience reasons.

Special properties of the class
-------------------------------

Vectors can be indexed with numbers and allow method and operator syntax.

All these forms of addressing a vector `v` are valid:
`v[1]`, `v[3]`, `v.x`, `v[1] = 42`, `v.y = 13`
Note: Prefer letter over number indexing for performance and compatibility reasons.

Where `v` is a vector and `foo` stands for any function name, `v:foo(...)` does
the same as `vector.foo(v, ...)`, apart from deprecated functionality.

`tostring` is defined for vectors, see `vector.to_string`.

The metatable that is used for vectors can be accessed via `vector.metatable`.
Do not modify it!

All `vector.*` functions allow vectors `{x = X, y = Y, z = Z}` without metatables.
Returned vectors always have a metatable set.

vector = {}

-- Unofficial notes:
-- Please treat vectors like they are immutable as much as you can, unless for performance reasons, in that case get rid of that metatable
-- Example:
--[[
local x_coords = {}
local y_coords = {}
local z_coords = {}

local vec_t = {}

....

vec_t.x = x_coords[n]
vec_t.y = y_coords[n]
vec_t.z = z_coords[n]

This will probably drastically reduce on garbage collector use, as vectors are HORRIBLE for it
