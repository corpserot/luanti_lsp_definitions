on_blast = function(pos, intensity),
intensity: 1.0 = mid range of regular TNT.
If defined, called when an explosion touches the node, instead of
removing the node.
Unofficial note: this is a custom field, just documented in lua_api.md i assume because TNT mods usually don't handle indestructible nodes/whatever very well
